# Cry Tracker + Social Network: NoCryShy
## Synopsis
No Cry Shy is a web application that allows users to keep track of their cries and connect with friends. Users can log details about their cry session, including their location, the date and time, the length and severity, the reason, the trigger, and how they feel. Users will also be able to optionally share these details and photos with their friends, creating a social component will allow users to share their feelings and react to others’ cry sessions.

## Summary
We all need a good cry every now and then. Crying relieves pain and stress and helps regulate our emotions. Keeping track of our cries can give us the chance to self-reflect and create bonds with others over our shared humanity.

No Cry Shy is a web application that allows us to do that: a tool for both self-reflection and connection. This tool will consist of two main components: personal tracking and social interaction. The tracking component will allow users to record details about their cry session. These details include their location, the date and time, the length and severity, the reason, the trigger, and how they feel. Recording these details over time will hopefully allow users to identify patterns and react accordingly. The social component will allow users to share experiences with close friends and react to others’ experiences. Users will be able to stay connected with friends, build empathy, and support one another.
What we really want to focus on is emphasizing the social aspect of our app, which primarily involves posting crying pictures and reacting to your friends’. When a user first logs onto the app, we want to send them to a feed where they can view all of their friends’ pictures – similar to BeReal. A user can click on a picture and either react to it, send a message to the friend, or view more information on the picture. The original poster of the picture may have included more information on their cry, which the user can access by clicking on the image.
The second tab a user can click is the ‘how are you feeling’ tab: here, they can log information on their last cry. The user can also view how their mood was and what their cry patterns in the last week, month, and year. 

The third component is the ‘tell your friends how you’re feeling’ tab, which is where a user can take a picture of themselves and post it. They can add a caption to the picture, talking about why they cried and how they’re feeling now. And lastly, the fourth component is just a system to send direct messages to friends. 

We wanted to make sure our product was unique and adding value to this problem space. Currently, there is an app (iOS and Android) called Tracking My Tears. The app includes a personal tracker and community wall. What makes our product different is the social and photo aspects. The Tracking My Tears app has a community wall, but this wall includes all users on the app who make their posts public. There is no option to connect with friends and share with them privately. Additionally, there is no support for uploading or sharing pictures, which we feel is one of the biggest attractions of our product. While Tracking My Tears has the basic tracking functionality, we feel the app’s aesthetic and features are not attractive to our target market, which is teens and young adults. The app uses dark colors and is very serious overall. While we want to give space for negative emotions and complex issues people are facing, we also want our app to have a more positive energy with colorful visuals and connections with friends that make people actually want to use the app. We believe there is space and a need for an app like NoCryShy.
